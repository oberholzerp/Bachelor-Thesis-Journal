reqd_work_size(2,2,1) does not lead to the correct result

no work_group_size_set
 - result is still 200 instead of 100

build slightly modified kernel
 - no get_local_id
 - count[0] is increased by 1
 - still wrong result

reqd_work_size(2,1,1) does not lead to the correct result

build modified kernel (input and output stored in different variables)
 - result correct
