debug execution of 2mm on FPGA with extralarge dataset and datatype int
 - replacing all double identifier by int to get rid of the segfault
 - execution 2mm on FPGA
	 - started: 08:52
	 - finished: ??:??
	 - canceled execution, because it took more than 1h

block-ram stores and loads have to be placed before every kernel enqueue
 - leaving the memory allocated during two calls of a kernel is not working in hardware emulation
 - TODO check if this behavior occurs during execution on FPGA

build 2mm kernel without reqd_work_group_size(32,16,1) specified for hardware emulation
 - running hw_emu on fpga1 machine (started 11:50)
