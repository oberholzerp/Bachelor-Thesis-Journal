modified script place_route.sh for 2mm to see if I can fix the problem with the access to the xilinx installation
	- added export of the xilinx installation to the script
	- start place and route of kernel.cl with xocc
	- submitted script with the command «bsub -o outputXOCC.txt < place_route.sh»
	- wrote an e-mail to the cluster support

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (extralarge * 10) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- data transfer time is roughly the same as with normal extralarge dataset

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (extralarge * 100) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- error during memory allocation process
		- not enough memory

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (all four values set to 24000) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- data transfer time is the same as with original extralarge dataset

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (all four values set to 30000) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- data transfer time is the same as with original extralarge dataset

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (all four values set to 100000) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- error:
		- int overflow
		- segfault

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (all four values set to 50000) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- error int overflow

added larger dataset to 2mm benchmark (all four values set to 40000) to see if the data transfer time is getting larger
	- started 2mm benchmark with modified extralarge dataset
	- data transfer time is the same as with original extralarge dataset

added Application Emulation introduction to the appendix
	- added explanation CPU emulation
	- added explanation of hardware emulation

problem with fpga execution occured
	- CL_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND
	- wrote a mail to Johannes
