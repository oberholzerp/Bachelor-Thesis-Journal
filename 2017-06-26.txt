added workgroup size to (1,1,1) (optimization unrolling innermost loop)
place and route 2mm kernel
	- error during execution (invalid work group size)
		- local_work_size of host (during call of the kernel) and workgroup size of the kernel do not match

added description of clGetPlatformIDs to the appendix

added loop unrolling to the outer loops of 2mm
place and route 2mm kernel

added description of clEnqueueMigrateMemObjects to the appendix

added description of clEnqueueWriteBuffer to the appendix

added OpenCL profiling code explanation to the appendix

added an explanation of pipelining to the appendix

added workgroup size to (32,16,1) (optimization unrolling innermost loop)
place and route 2mm kernel
	- execution of 1 test sample
		- takes longer than without loop unrolling
	- started 10 executions of 2mm kernel with inner loop unrolling by factor 2

added overview of the OpenCL platform model to the appendix

changed loop enrolling from 2 to 4
place and route 2mm_kernel.cl
	- started 10 executions
