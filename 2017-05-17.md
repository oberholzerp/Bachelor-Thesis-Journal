Work done on 17th May:

- modified ocl_utilities.c such that it is able to compile for FPGAs

- still an error during execution
		ERROR: clCreateProgramWithSource() is not supported, please use clCreateProgramWithBinary().
		Could not build the program.
	- TODO change clCreateProgramWithSource to clCreateProgramWithBinary

- moved some stuff from the background section to the appendix
