changed loop unrolling from 4 to 8 in inner loop of 2mm_kernel.cl
place and route 2mm_kernel.cl
	- execute sample to ensure all tags are set correctly and there are no errors

added overview of OpenCL memory model to the appendix

place and route 2mm_kernel.cl with -O3 argument (loop unrolling by 8)
	- started 1 execution to check if it works correct

added illustration of SDAccel recommended flow - image out of sdaccel-optimization-guide

plotted comparison of profiling data of gpu and fpga with non-optimized kernels

place and route 2mm_kernel.cl with -03 argument, no loop unrolling
	- too slow during execution

place and route 2mm_kernel.cl without work group size specification in 2mm_kernel.cl
	- no optimizations

plotted comparison of profiling data of fpga no optimization and loop unrolling by 2

plotted comparison of profiling data of fpga no optimization and loop unrolling by 4

plotted comparison of profiling data of fpga no optimization and loop unrolling by 8
