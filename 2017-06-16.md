first try to enable opencl profiling
	- segmentation fault with data type float
	- segmentation fault occurs even if opencl profiling is not in code (data type float)
		- 6 hours debugging for nothing :-(
	- execution of 2mm xl dataset, datatype int on gpu
	- kernel (2mm kernel0) execution time is 4.221ms on gpu (xl dataset, data type int)
