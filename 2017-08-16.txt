build kernel with get_local_id and __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(2,1,1)))
 - result is wrong (getting 200 instead of 100)

added description of software and hardware emulation to the appendix

debuging software emulation
 - *** stack smashing detected ***: ./time.exe terminated
	Aborted (core dumped)

debuging hardware emulation
 - working -- taking very long
 - prints result at the end
 - hardware emulation gives correct result back if get_local_id is used
 - hardware emulation gives correct result back if get_global_id is used

hardware emulation of simple addition kernel
 - changing global work size from 2 to 4 (in host code) does not change the result (result is 100 (correct))
 - changing global work size from 2 to 40 (in host code) does not change the result (result is 100 (correct))
 - bigger global_work_size -> longer execution time
 - bigger global_work_size -> more memory used

hardware emulation of 2mm
 - some errors
	ERROR: Invalid scalar argument size, expected 4 got 8
	ERROR: clSetKernelArg() for kernel "kernel0", argument index 2.

	ERROR: Invalid scalar argument size, expected 4 got 8
