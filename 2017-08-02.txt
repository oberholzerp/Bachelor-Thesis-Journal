generated some xpirbc files of different work_group_sizes to see if those have an influence on the result generated by the FPGA
 - no work_group_size set
 - __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(2,2,2)))
 - modified kernel
	 - just adding 1 to the first element of the array

wrote a script to place and route those three kernels
 - not working because building kernels from spir needs more debugging

building kernel in test-execution directly from OpenCL kernel
 - set reqd_work_group_size(2,2,1)
