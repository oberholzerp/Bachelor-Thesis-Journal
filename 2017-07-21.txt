looking for workaround of xocc errors
 - compile kernel.cl to kernel.xpirbc.linked.xpirbc
	 - no errors
 - xocc with kernel.xpirbc.linked.xpirbc as input file
	 - still errors
		ERROR: [XOCC 60-704] Integration error, One or more synthesis runs failed during ocl dcp generation
		ERROR: [XOCC 60-597] Kernel build failed to complete
		ERROR: [XOCC 60-702] Failed to finish compilation and linking
