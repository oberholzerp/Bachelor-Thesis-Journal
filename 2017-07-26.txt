test if kernel creation out of xpirbc is delivering correct results
 - wrote a small kernel that adds 1 to count 100 times
 - generate a xpirbc out of the kernel
 - generate a xclbin out of the xpirbc
	 - failed
		 - Failed to build kernel(ip) kernel0
 - generate a xclbin out of cl
	 - successful

generating host and kernel code out of polybench benchmarks
 - options:
	 - extralarge dataset
	 - datatype int
	 - scalar loop bounds
	 - c99 proto

build vector_add (xpirbc file from alex)
 - successful
	 - out of OpenCL kernel file
		 - create xpirbc -> create xclbin
	 - out of xpirbc
		 - create xclbin out of xpirbc from alex
