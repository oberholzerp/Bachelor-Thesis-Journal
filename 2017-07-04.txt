executing the xclbin file generated on euler does not work
	- error message: Invalid Binary
	  ERROR: Failed to parse ./xmltmp___
		- maybe adding options solves the problem
			- adding options did not solve the problem
		- sourced some setup_sdaccel.sh similar to the one on the fpga1 machine

place and route 2mm and 2mm -O3 on euler with options

place and route 3mm and 3mm -O3 on euler with options

place and route gemver and gemver -O3 on euler with options

added illustration and explanation for overlapping data transfer with kernel computation to the appendix

place and route gemver -O3 on fpga1 machine to look for differences
	- xclbin from fpga1 machine starts with xclbin0 followed by some readable lines, whereas xclbin from euler starts with xclbin2 and has those human readable lines at the end

added illustration and explanation of multiple in-order command queues to the appendix

added illustration and explanation for single out-of-order command queues to the appendix

place and rout 2mm -O3 on fpga1 machine

added image dataflow optimization to the appendix

place and route gemver on euler
	- no polybench flags set
	- JobID: 46247708

added short description of ppcg to the appendix

iterated through ppcg section in the appendix

place and route jacobi-2d on fpga1

started execution of jacobi-2d on FPGA
