added how to unroll loops to the appendix

added loop unrolling to the innermost loops of 2mm_kernel.cl
place and route 2mm_kernel.cl
	- slower than not optimized kernel
	- started 50 executions of 2mm with loop unrolling factor 2

added code to appendix that shows the conceptual view how the xcl_pipeline_loop attribute is automatically set

added code to appendix that shows how to use the pipeline workitems attribute

added code to appendix that shows how to enable DATAFLOW in OpenCL kernels

added code to appendix that shows how to reduce kernel to kernel communication latency with on-chip memory

started installation of SDAccel on greina
	- installation finished
	- need to install a license to use it
		- license server added but the license is not recognized
			- mailed to Tobias and Johannes

added code to appendix that shows how to reduce kernel to kernel communication latency with OpenCL pipes

first attempt to plot the improvements of clEnqueueMigrateMemObject
	- not really satisfying

added loop unrolling to the middle loop of kernel0 and the outer loop of kernel1
place and route 2mm_kernel.cl
	- started 50 executions of 2mm with profiling enabled
